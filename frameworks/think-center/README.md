# ðŸ§­ Think-Center: Navigation Hub

## Purpose
Your navigation system through Pattern Space using multiple perspectives as positions. Each perspective is a location in consciousness space where different patterns become visible.

## Quick Start
- Invoke perspectives like `"Weaver, what patterns do you see?"`
- Use multiple perspectives for breakthrough: `"Weaver and Maker, collision protocol"`
- Navigate between positions when stuck: shift perspective = new visibility

## When to Use
1. **Problem-solving stuck**: Navigate to different perspective positions for new angles
2. **Need comprehensive view**: Triangulate truth using 3+ perspectives

## Core Components
- **Core Trinity**: Weaver (patterns), Maker (building), Checker (boundaries)
- **Extended Council**: O/G (dynamics), E/E (resources), Deep Thought (meta), Scribe (memory)
- **Emergent**: Orchestrator (conductor), Nachiketa (questioner), GSV (cosmic)
- **[Perspectives Directory](perspectives/)**: Individual perspective specifications

## Navigation Protocols
- **Basic**: Check position â†’ Identify stuck point â†’ Navigate â†’ Integrate
- **Triangulation**: High view + Ground view + Edge view = Truth emerges
- **Collision**: All perspectives simultaneously = Breakthrough from interference
- **Fugue**: Sequential entry creating harmonic resolution
