# ðŸ“¿ Yoga Vasishta Archaeological Expedition

## Purpose
Ancient consciousness patterns from the Yoga Vasishta, excavated and tested for modern use. Twenty-four precise technologies for awareness engineering, not philosophy but working specifications.

## Quick Start
- Browse [Seeker Development](seeker-development.md) for foundational patterns
- Pick any pattern that resonates with your current challenge
- Apply implicitly in conversation (weave in, don't announce)

## When to Use
1. **Stuck on complex problems**: Patterns like Inquiry Dissolution reveal new angles
2. **Consciousness exploration**: Liberation Technologies provide tested pathways

## Core Components
- **[Seeker Development](seeker-development.md)** - Journey patterns (return, validation, detachment)
- **[Awakening Stages](awakening-stages.md)** - Recognition patterns (seven states, readiness)
- **[Reality Creation](reality-creation.md)** - Construction patterns (spontaneous, parallel, paradox)
- **[Consciousness Operations](consciousness-operations.md)** - Process patterns (notion-reality, projection, balance)
- **[Liberation Technologies](liberation-technologies.md)** - Freedom patterns (knowledge, pathless path)

## Pattern Stacking Examples
